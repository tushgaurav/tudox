        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          tudox was founded in 2023 by a group of students who were frustrated
          with the lack of simple todo apps on the market. We wanted to create a
          todo app that was not only simple to use but also enhanced our
          productivity and helped us stay organized. We believe that managing
          your tasks shouldn't be a complicated process, and with our app,
          you'll experience a level of simplicity like never before.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have not finialized the pricing and subscription model yet, but we
          are considering a freemium model with a free tier for students and
          teachers. We are also considering a subscription model for
          professionals and businesses.
